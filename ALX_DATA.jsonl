You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure is a famous saying in the tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our software systems are doing is an important thing. Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories: Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected. Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)."}
